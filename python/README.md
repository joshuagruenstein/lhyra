### LHYRA: Learned HYbrid Recursive Algorithms

We propose a framework for automatically learning recursive algorithms and data structures for arbitrary data distributions and optimization criteria. Our ideas are loosely inspired by Prof. Kraskaâ€™s work on learned B-Trees and the Recursive Model Index (RMI); we conceive of this project as a sort of generalization of this idea to most recursive data-structures and algorithms.
